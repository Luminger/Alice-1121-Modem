RedHat 4.0 sample configuration files
=====================================

Known restrictions
------------------

 - no support for manually configured ATMARP entries (SVC or PVC)
 - no LANE (neither client nor server)
 - no ANS


Overview
--------

/etc/sysconfig/atm
    Indicates if ATM is desired, which ATM components are used, and may
    contain configuration options for system-wide resources (e.g. ilmid)

/etc/rc.d/init.d/atm  (atm.init)
    Is executed at system startup to initialize the ATM subsystem (e.g.
    to start all the demons), and at system shutdown to remove the
    demons it started.

/etc/atmsigd.conf
    ATM signaling demon configuration, see  man atmsigd.conf

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-atm*
    Per-interface configuration parameters. This file contains highly
    site-specific data.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-atm
    General interface bringup procedure. Creates the IP over ATM interface,
    configures it, adds the route, and creates all the necessary ATMARP
    information.

In addition to the files listed above, files from atm/config/common need to
be installed. See atm/config/common/README for details.


Installation
------------

In order to use the configuraton scripts in this directory, you have to
install ATM on Linux as follows:

# cd wherever/atm    # top-level directory of the ATM distribution tree
# INSTPREFIX=/usr/local make -e uninstall    # remove the old files
# INSTPREFIX=/usr make -e install    # install everything under /usr

Then copy the configuration files:

# cd config
# make redhat-4.0

Finally, you may have to edit /etc/sysconfig/atm, /etc/atmsigd.conf,
and /etc/hosts.atm

If you're using IP over ATM, you _must_ change
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-atm0 as follows:

DEVICE		name of the interface (e.g. atm0, atm1, ...)
IPADDR		IP address of the host on that ATM LIS
NETMASK		network mask of that ATM LIS
BROADCAST	broadcast address (not really used at the moment, but
		must be configured to a sane value)
ARPSRV		ATM address of the ATMARP server serving that LIS. May
		be a symbolic name if /etc/hosts.atm is being used. Omit
		this variable if the local machine is acting as the
		ATMARP server of that LIS.
ARPSRVQOS	optional; QOS of the ATMARP server VC
ARPDEFQOS	optional; default QOS for IP over ATM VCs
ONBOOT		must be set to "no" in order to bring up interfaces only
		after the demons are running

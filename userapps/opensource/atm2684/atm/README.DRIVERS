If you're just looking for the device drivers: they're either
already in the mainstream kernel (see below) or in atm.patch

After applying that patch to the appropriate kernel source tree
(see file USAGE for details), you'll find them in the directory
drivers/atm

Driver which haven't been integrated yet can be found on
http://icawww1.epfl.ch/linux-atm/info.html

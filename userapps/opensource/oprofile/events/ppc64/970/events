# ppc64 POWERPC970 events
#
#  Within each group the event names must be unique.  Each event in a group is
#  assigned to a unique counter.  The groups are from the groups defined in the
#  PowerPC970 manual.
#
#  Only events within the same group can be selected simultaneously
#  Each event is given a unique event number.  The event number is used by the
#  Oprofile code to resolve event names for the postprocessing.  This is done
#  to preserve compatibility with the rest of the Oprofile code.  The event 
#  number format group_num followed by the counter number for the event within
#  the group.  The event number must be between 0 and 100 hex.

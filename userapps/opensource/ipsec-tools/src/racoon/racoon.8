.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
speaks IKE
.Pq ISAKMP/Oakley
key management protocol,
to establish security association with other hosts.
SPD
.Pq Security Policy Database
in the kernel usually triggers to start
.Nm racoon .
.Nm racoon
usually sends all of informational messages, warnings and error messages to
.Xr syslogd 8
with the facility LOG_DAEMON, the priority LOG_INFO.
Debugging messages are sent with the priority LOG_DEBUG.
You should configure
.Xr syslog.conf 5
appropriately to see these messages.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B
Install SA(s) from the file which is specified in
.Xr racoon.conf 5 .
.It Fl F
Run

in the foreground.
.It Fl f Ar configfile
Use
.Ar configfile
as the configuration file instead of the default.
.It Fl l Ar logfile

.Ar logfile
as the logging file instead of
.Xr syslogd 8 .
.It Fl p Ar isakmp-port
Listen to ISAKMP key exchange on port
.Ar isakmp-port
instead of the default port number, 500.
.It Fl P Ar isakmp-natt-port
Use 
.Ar isakmp-natt-port
for NAT-Traversal port-floating. The default is 4500.

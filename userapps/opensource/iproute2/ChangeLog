	* Make ip xfrm stuff config option since it doesn't exist on 2.4

	* HFSC doesn't exist on older 2.4 kernels so make it configurable

	* HTB API changed and won't build with mismatched version.
	  Rather than sticking user with a build error, just don't
	  build it in on mismatch.

	* Change configure script to make sure netem is the correct
	  version. I changed the structure def. a couple of times before
	  settling on the final API

2004-07-16  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Add htb mpu support 
	http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/qos/htb/v3/htb_tc_overhead.diff
	* Three small xfrm updates

2004-07-07  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Fix if_ether.h to fix arpd build
	* Add hfsc scheduler support
	* Add ip xfrm support
	* Add add jitter (instead of rate) to netem scheduler

2004-07-02  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* use compile to test for ATM libraries
	* put TC layered scheduler hooks in /usr/lib/tc as shared lib
	  before it looked in standard search path (/lib;/usr/lib;...)
	  which seems out of place.
	* build netem as shared library (more for testing/example)
	* build ATM as shared library since libatm may be on build
	  machine but not on deployment machine
	* fix make install to not install SCCS directories

2004-07-01  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* add more link options to ip command (from Mark Smith
	* add rate and duplicate arguments to tc command
	* add -iec flag for tc printout
	* rename delay scheduler to netem

2004-06-25  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Add loss parameter to delay
	* Rename delay qdisc to netsim
	* Add autoconfiguration by building a Config file
	  and using it.

2004-06-09  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Report rates in K=1000 (requested by several people)
	* Add GNU long style options
	* For HTB use get_hz to pick up value of system HZ at runtime
	* Delete unused funcs.

2004-06-08  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Cleanup ss
	     - use const char and local functions where possible
	* Add man pages from SuSe
	* SuSE patches
	     - path to db4.1
	     - don't hardcode path to /tmp in ifstat
	       Alternat fix: was to use TMPDIR
	     - handle non-root user calling ip route flush going into
	       an infinite loop.
	       Alternate fix: was to timeout if route table doesn't empty.
	* Try and get rid of dependency on kernel include files
	  Get rid of having private glibc-include headers
	
2004-06-07  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Import patches that make sense from Fedora Core 2
		- iproute2-2.4.7-hex
		     print fwmark in hex
		- iproute2-2.4.7-netlink
		     handle getting right netlink mesg back
		- iproute2-2.4.7-htb3-tc
		     add HTB scheduler
		- iproute2-2.4.7-default
		     add entry default to rttable

	* Add support for vegas info to ss

2004-06-02  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Use const char in utility routines where appropriate
	* Rearrange include files so can build with standard headers
	* For "tc qdisc ls" see the default queuing discpline "pfifo_fast"
	  and understand it
	* Get rid of private defintions of network headers which existed
	  only to handle old glibc

2004-04-15  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Add the delay (network simulation scheduler)

2004-04-15  Stephen Hemminger  <shemminger@osdl.org>

	* Starting point baseline based on iproute2-2.4.7-ss020116-try

File:		rt_cache_stat.dif
Apply to:	kernel < 2.4.7
Status:		recommended for kernels < 2.4.7.
		already present in >= 2.4.7
Description:	tracing efficiency of routing cache
Side effects:	none

File:		pidentd-3.0.12.dif
Apply to:	pident-3.0.12 tree f.e. from am redhat rpm
Status:		highly recommended
Description:	Patch to pidentd allowing to use tcpdiag facility and fixing
		some bugs in original pident.
Side effects:	none. Does not break anything not depending on kernel version,
		even if tcpdiag is absent.
Advice:		not related to this patch but should be said yet.
		Do NOT configure pidentd to use threads! Use option
		"--without-threads" when doing "configure".
		pidentd is typical example of application where
		threading results in nothing but collapse of performance.
		Apparently author learned thread programming and decided
		to apply new knowledge to the first victim.

File:		symbol_exports.dif 
Apply to:	kernel < 2.4.17
Status:		desired for kernels < 2.4.17
		not needed for kernels >= 2.4.17
Description:	exports symbols required to load tcpdiag module
		tcpdiag is builtin since 2.4.17, hence the exports
		are redundant.
Side effects:	none

File:		af_unix.dif
Apply to:	kernel
Status:		recommended
Desciption:	implements fragmented skb for unix sockets reducing
		vm pressure for datagram sockets and adds to /proc/net/unix
		columns allowing to monitor recv/send memory and identify
		peer of connected sockets.
Side effects:	"lsof" blames something about unix sockets.
		Not a big loss, lsof is not able to tell anything more
		clever than "can't identify protocol" for sockets anyway. 
Note:		the patch affects area where one or two lines changed
		several times while 2.4. It does not depend on this,
		but unfortunately may reject. It apply cleanly to
		2.4.17.
